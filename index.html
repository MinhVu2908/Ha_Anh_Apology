    <h2>Dear Ha Anh,</h2>
    <p>I want to start by again saying how truly sorry I am for my actions and how deeply I regret the hurt I caused you. I know that no words can undo the pain I have caused, but I want you to know that I am writing this letter with nothing but sincerity and remorse.</p>
    <p>I’ve had time to reflect on what happened, and I realize now more than ever how my actions affected you. It was never my intention to hurt you, and I deeply regret that I did. You mean so much to me, and I understand how important trust is in any relationship. I broke that trust, and I fully take responsibility for my mistakes.</p>
    <p>I want to be better, not just in words but in actions. I am committed to changing and growing from this, and I want to work towards earning back your trust and rebuilding what was damaged. I know this will take time, and I don’t expect forgiveness to come easily, but I want you to know that I am willing to put in the effort because you are worth it.</p>
    <p>Please know that I will do everything in my power to ensure this doesn’t happen again. I’ve learned from this, and I am determined to be the person you can rely on and trust once more.</p>
    <p>Thank you for taking the time to read this. I truly hope you can find it in your heart to forgive me one day. Regardless of how long it takes, I am here, ready to work on things, because I care about you deeply.</p>
    <p>With all my sincerity,<br>Minh Vu</p>
